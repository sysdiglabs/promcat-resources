  Intelligently control the flow of traffic and API calls between services, conduct a range of tests, and upgrade gradually with red/black deployments.
  Automatically secure your services through managed authentication, authorization, and encryption of communication between services.
  Apply policies and ensure that theyâ€™re enforced, and that resources are fairly distributed among consumers.
  See what's happening with rich automatic tracing, monitoring, and logging of all your services.
