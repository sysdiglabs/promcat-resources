# NTP
[NTP](http://www.ntp.org/) The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a networking protocol for clock synchronization between computer systems over packet-switched, variable-latency data networks. In operation since before 1985, NTP is one of the oldest Internet protocols in current use. NTP was designed by David L. Mills of the University of Delaware.

To extract metrics you can use the [NTP Exporter](https://github.com/sapcc/ntp_exporter).

# Metrics
The metrics available are the ones related to the modules:
* Drift

# Number of time series generated
* Each instance generates ~4 metrics

# Attributions
The configuration files, dashboards, and alerts maintained by [Sysdig team](https://sysdig.com/).
